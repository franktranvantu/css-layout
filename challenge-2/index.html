      <h1>The verdict is in. CSS Layout is great!</h1>
      <p>I’ve been working with CSS for a while now, and I have to say, it’s pretty awesome. I love being able to separate
        content from presentation, and to keep all my styles in an external stylesheet.</p>
      <p>I’ve had a pretty good grasp on the basics for a while now, but I needed to learn more about how to control
        layout with my CSS. Understanding CSS layout meant first exploring the parts of the CSS box model.</p>

      <h2>The CSS Box Model</h2>
      <p>There are lots of great resources online to help you learn the CSS Box Model. I like the CSS Tricks article <a
          href="https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/" target="_blank">The CSS Box Model</a> by Chris Coyier. To quote
        the author:</p>
      <blockquote>At the risk of over-repeating myself: <strong>every element in web design is a rectangular box.</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That’s right! Every HTML element is considered by the browser to be a rectangular box.</p>
      <p>The CSS Box Model consists of four properties: content, padding, border, and margin. I've included a graphic from
        Coyier’s article to illustrate this principle.</p>
      <p class="clear">It’s pretty easy to understand the Content portion of the box model. The content is whatever your
        HTML consists of. It could be a paragraph full of text, or a bulleted list, or an image.</p>
      <p>Beginning developers may have some trouble keeping the other parts of the box model straight, so let’s examine
        them one by one.</p>
