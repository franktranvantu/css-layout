Using CSS Media Queries, you can build a website that remains legible on a variety of viewports and device orientations. 

However, it’s critical that you let mobile browsers know your content is mobile-optimized.

Luckily, preventing mobile browsers from zooming out automatically is pretty simple. 

We’re going to add a meta viewport declaration to the head of every page of our website that’s mobile optimized.
