In our last section, we used CSS media queries to optimize our layout for the printed page. 

While that’s useful, and a fun exercise, I would imagine you’re anxious to design for different screen sizes. 

After all, few things are more exciting for a front end web developer than launching a site that looks equally great on a small and large screen. 

To target different characteristics of the screen viewing our web page, we need more than just to select the media type, as we did in our last video. 

We need to write CSS rules that apply only when certain characteristics are met–when the device is in landscape format, for example, or when the viewport is wider than 800 pixels.
